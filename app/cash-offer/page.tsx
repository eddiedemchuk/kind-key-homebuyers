      "We typically provide cash offers within 24 hours of receiving your property information. After a quick walkthrough (virtual or in-person), we'll present you with a transparent, no-obligation cash offer.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the cash offer free and with no obligation?',
    answer:
      'Yes. KindKey does not charge you to submit property information or request an offer, and the offer comes with no obligation. You are free to accept, decline, or take time to think it over.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you determine the cash offer amount?',
    answer:
      'We evaluate your property based on its location, condition, size, and current market value. We consider comparable sales in your area and provide a fair, transparent cash offer that reflects the true value of your property.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the cash offer change after the walkthrough?',
    answer:
      'Our initial cash offer is based on the information you provide. After the walkthrough, we may adjust the offer if there are significant differences from what was described, but we always communicate any changes transparently. Most offers remain the same.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after I accept the cash offer?',
    answer: `Once you accept our cash offer, KindKey coordinates its side of the purchase with escrow or the closing agent. We can typically close within 7-14 days while working with your schedule. ${APPROVED_TRANSACTION_DISCLOSURE}`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to make repairs before getting a cash offer?',
    answer:
      "No! We buy houses in any condition. You don't need to clean, repair, or improve anything. We'll make you a cash offer based on your property's current condition, whether it needs minor fixes or major repairs.",
