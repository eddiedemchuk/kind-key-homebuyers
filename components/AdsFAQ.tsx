      question: 'Do I need to make repairs before selling?',
      answer: `No! We buy houses in {cityName} exactly as they are. Whether your house needs minor cosmetic fixes or major repairs, we'll make you a fair cash offer. You do not need to make repairs before the sale; KindKey handles repairs after purchase.`,

    {
      question: 'How fast can we close?',
      answer: `We can close in as little as 7 days, but we work with your timeline. Whether you need to close quickly or need more time to move out, we're flexible. Most transactions in {cityName} close within 7-14 days, but we can accommodate your schedule.`,

    },
    {
      question: 'What types of homes do you buy?',
      answer: `We buy all types of residential properties in {cityName}: single-family homes, condos, townhouses, multi-family properties, and even land. Condition doesn't matter - we buy houses that need repairs, have tenants, are vacant, or are in perfect condition.`,
